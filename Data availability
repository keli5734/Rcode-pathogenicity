In vivo kinetic data of both virus and macrophage populations for model-fitting
in this study were extracted using 361 WebPlotDigitizer (version 4.4) from Perrone et al. (2008). 
Female BALB/c mice were intranasally infected with HP (A/1918 H1N1 and A/Thailand/16/2004 H5N1) and LP 
(A/Texas/36/91 H1N1 and A/Thailand/SP/83/2004 H5N1) influenza viruses, and lungs 
were harvested for viral load and macrophage measurement at various time points 
post-infection. Three mice were measured per time point for infection with each viral strain.
